**This project is called GOFOOD. No it's THE BLUE HARVEST. No it doesn't have a name.**


This is a food takeout / food delivery platform. On this platform restaurant / business managers can set up their home page and put out menus, where anonymous / registered customers can order food on a takeout / delivery order.


Managers can:
* register businesses
* display menus
* receive orders (takeout or delivery)
* confirm received orders with estimated time or decline orders
* confirm order is picked up or delivered


Customers can:
* search restaurants using keywords and location (enabled by Google Map Geocoding API)
* visit restaurant page for menu and other information (description, rating, location, opening hours)
* order food (takeout or delivery, delivery only possible if within delivery distance set by restaurant)
* rate restaurant when order confirmed
